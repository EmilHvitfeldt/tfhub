\description{
Module to construct a dense 1-D representation from the pixels of images.
}
\details{
This feature column can be used on images, represented as float32 tensors of RGB pixel
data in the range [0,1]. This can be read from a
\href{column_numeric()}{https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tfestimators/reference/column_numeric.html}
if the input data happens to have decoded images, all with the same shape [height,
width, 3]. More commonly, the
\href{input_fn}{https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tfestimators/articles/input_functions.html}
will have code to explicitly decode images, resize them (possibly after performing data
augmentation such as random crops etc.), and provide a batch of shape [batch_size,
height, width, 3].
